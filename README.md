# Stream Countdown

A simple page used to start a countdown to a point in time.

I made this for when I'm streaming at [https://j7e.no/live](https://j7e.no/live).

## Usage

Navigate to the page and use the following query parameters to customize:

Query parameter | Description
--- | ---
`h` | The hour to count down to
`m` | The minute of the hour to count down to
`t` | The text to display above the countdown
